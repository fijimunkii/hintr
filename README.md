Waiting to be discovered.

Whatâ€™s already there might be hard to find.

Using facebook is like finding a needle in a haystack.

Find the needle in your haystack.


Hintr takes all the people in your network and matches you based on your interests. It presents you with people you perhaps didn't know you had so much in common with and raises new possibilities for people to connect with. Then it gives you he option of messaging that person or of removing them from your feed if you don't agree that they'd be a good match. It refreshes every day, so you will always have new people to connect with from your own friends' list waiting for you. It is based on the premise that though we have so many facebook friends, we don't remember who all of them are. Sometimes people fixate on meeting new people and they don't think about reconnecting with someone they knew only vaguely in the past. It makes suggestions to connect with people based on information that's already there, waiting to be discovered.
